# SolarSimplify

SolarSimplify is a web application prototype developed by Vincent Limbach for the Tech Challenge of Unternehmer TUM. Much of the content was researched by Adam Gelis and Melisa Uzunoglu. The project aims to simplify engagement with solar energy solutions through an intuitive web interface streamling the informing process.

## Overview

### 1. Introduction

SolarSimplify is implemented using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. The system provides a user-friendly interface to access information related to solar energy, including legal, financial, and vendor-related details. Additionally, the platform introduces users to the concept of Energy Communities (EC) and facilitates the creation of new ECs through a marketplace.

### 2. Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Express (Node.js)
- Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- Hosting: AWS EC2
- Networking: IPv4, IPv6, TCP, HTTPS
